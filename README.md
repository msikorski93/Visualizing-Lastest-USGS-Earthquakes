# Visualizing-Lastest-USGS-Earthquakes
This notebook contains an introduction to the use of Python and <code>cartopy</code> to visualize data concerning earthquakes. We will first read a file with earthquake locations (latitudes, and longitudes), magnitudes in Richter scale, and depths, and other descriptors and then overlay it on a worldwide map.<br>
The same map was created in <code>folium</code> for interactive use. It is available with nbviewer link:<br>
