# Visualizing-Lastest-USGS-Earthquakes
This notebook contains an introduction to the use of Python and cartopy to visualize data concerning earthquakes. We will first read a file with earthquake locations (latitudes, and longitudes), magnitudes in Richter scale, and depths, and other descriptors and then overlay it on a worldwide map.
